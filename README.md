## Description

CoTeach is a web application allowing teachers across the world access to video lessons and classroom resources. We believe that educators deserve to have a healthy work-life balance-- CoTeach saves teachers time, which ultimately benefits them and their students.

Built using the MERN stack, CoTeach is a single-page application where all users can learn from a veteran mentor. Users who register with Google's Firebase oauth system can upload lessons and share their materials with other teachers in need.
